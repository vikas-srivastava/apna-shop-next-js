# Current Context

## Current Work Focus

- Memory bank initialization completed for Next.js eCommerce frontend project
- Third-party API integration ready (Foundry eCommerce API already integrated)
- CORS-free deployment strategy documented using Next.js API routes as proxy
- Atomic design component architecture established and documented
- Reusable theme template created for future Next.js installations
- API Integration Status: ~40% of Foundry eCommerce API endpoints integrated. Core features (products, auth, cart) complete, but major gaps in orders, payments, blog, shipping, and refunds.

## Recent Changes

- Memory bank fully initialized with all core files (brief.md, product.md, context.md, architecture.md, tech.md, api.md)
- Project structure comprehensively analyzed and documented
- Foundry eCommerce API OpenAPI documentation added to memory bank
- Next.js best practices for third-party API integration gathered from context7
- CORS proxy strategy documented with Next.js API route examples from context7
- next-theme-rules.md template created for fresh installations
- ApnaShop API proxy routes implemented with catch-all pattern (/api/apnashop/[...slug])
- Switchable mockup layer implemented for testing scenarios (NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK env var)
- Frontend services updated to use local proxy routes instead of direct third-party API calls
- Request forwarding implemented (headers, methods, body, query parameters)
- Proper error handling and response normalization added
- Local CORS-free deployment tested successfully
- Fixed Class Component compatibility issues in Next.js 13+ app directory by adding 'use client' directive to ErrorBoundary
- All routes and pages tested successfully (home, shop, login returning 200 status codes)

## Next Steps

1. Test CORS-free deployment on Vercel
2. Create tasks.md for repetitive implementation patterns
3. Document additional integration patterns and best practices
4. Optimize API proxy performance and caching strategies
5. Add comprehensive error monitoring and logging

## Priority API Integrations

- Order management and tracking
- Payment processing with Razorpay
- Shipping and delivery tracking
- Blog and CMS functionality
- Brands and categories management
- Refunds and customer support
