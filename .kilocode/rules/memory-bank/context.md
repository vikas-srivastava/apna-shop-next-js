# Current Context

## Current Work Focus

- Memory bank updated with accurate service names, class names, and architectural components
- Architecture documentation synchronized with latest codebase structure
- Module flows documentation enhanced with critical flows, error handling, and best practices
- Third-party API integration ready (Apna Shop APIs already integrated)
- CORS-free deployment strategy implemented using Next.js API routes as proxy
- Atomic design component architecture established and documented
- Reusable theme template created for future Next.js installations
- API Integration Status: ~40% of Apna Shop APIs endpoints integrated. Core features (products, auth, cart) complete, but major gaps in orders, payments, blog, shipping, and refunds.

## Recent Changes

- Memory bank updated with accurate service names, class names, and architectural components
- Architecture documentation synchronized with latest codebase structure
- Module flows documentation enhanced with critical flows, error handling, and best practices
- Memory bank fully initialized with all core files (brief.md, product.md, context.md, architecture.md, tech.md, api.md)
- Project structure comprehensively analyzed and documented
- Apna Shop APIs OpenAPI documentation added to memory bank
- Next.js best practices for third-party API integration gathered from context7
- CORS proxy strategy documented with Next.js API route examples from context7
- next-theme-rules.md template created for fresh installations
- ApnaShop API proxy routes implemented with catch-all pattern (/api/apnashop/[...slug])
- Switchable mockup layer implemented for testing scenarios (NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK env var)
- Frontend services updated to use local proxy routes instead of direct third-party API calls
- Request forwarding implemented (headers, methods, body, query parameters)
- Proper error handling and response normalization added
- Local CORS-free deployment tested successfully
- Fixed Class Component compatibility issues in Next.js 13+ app directory by adding 'use client' directive to ErrorBoundary
- **In-memory storage system implemented for persistent mock data across requests**
- **CartItem type added to TypeScript definitions**
- All routes and pages tested successfully (home, shop, login returning 200 status codes)
- **ðŸ”’ COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY HARDENING IMPLEMENTED** - Production-ready security measures deployed
- **Input validation & sanitization system** - Complete validation for all user inputs with XSS prevention
- **Rate limiting middleware** - Configurable limits for authentication, API, and payment endpoints
- **Security headers implementation** - OWASP recommended headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- **Authentication security enhancements** - JWT validation, session management, password hashing
- **Circuit breaker pattern** - Automatic failure detection and service isolation for API resilience
- **Advanced caching strategy** - Multi-level caching with TTL and performance monitoring
- **Comprehensive test suite** - Security validation, API performance, and system monitoring tests
- **Production-ready error handling** - Information leakage prevention and secure error responses
- **Password reset flow fully implemented** - Forgot password and reset password APIs connected to Apna Shop backend
- **User account APIs verified and working** - All auth endpoints (register, login, logout, profile, forgot-password, reset-password) properly connected to third-party APIs
- **Payment system enhanced** - Razorpay payment options updated to show Gpay, Paytm, UPI, Credit Card, Debit Card, Internet Banking with pre-selected methods
- **Environment variables updated** - Added NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID, RAZORPAY_SECRET_KEY, and placeholders for Stripe and PayPal keys
- **Payment gateway conditional rendering** - Stripe and PayPal payment options now enabled based on environment variable presence
- **Razorpay method pre-selection** - Payment window now opens with the selected payment method (Gpay, Paytm, UPI, etc.) already selected
- **Payment system simplified** - Removed all individual payment method options, kept only COD and "Pay Now" button for Razorpay
- **Checkout flow streamlined** - Payment step now shows only COD option with "Pay Now" (Razorpay) and "Review Order" buttons
## Next Steps

1. Test CORS-free deployment on Vercel
2. Create tasks.md for repetitive implementation patterns
3. Document additional integration patterns and best practices
4. Optimize API proxy performance and caching strategies
5. Add comprehensive error monitoring and logging

## Priority API Integrations

- Order management and tracking
- Payment processing with Razorpay
- Shipping and delivery tracking
- Blog and CMS functionality
- Brands and categories management
- Refunds and customer support
- Subscription and newsletter management
- Password reset and authentication enhancements
